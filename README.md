# Kanban Board


This project is a simple Kanban board application built with React. It features drag-and-drop functionality for task management, smooth card animations, keyboard accessibility, and persistence using localStorage. The application supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks, which can be assigned to one of the three columns: "To Do", "Progress", and "Completed".


## Features


- **Drag-and-Drop:** Use React Beautiful DnD to drag tasks between columns.
- **Smooth Animations:** Tasks move smoothly between columns with transition animations.
- **Keyboard Accessibility:** All task cards are accessible via keyboard, and the Enter key can be used for editing tasks.
- **LocalStorage Persistence:** Tasks are saved to localStorage so that they persist even after refreshing the page.
- **CRUD Operations:** Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Responsive Design:** The app adapts to different screen sizes.
